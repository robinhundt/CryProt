Implementation of linear codes for Silent OT extension.

Currently, only the expand-convolute code of [[RRT23]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/882) is implemented, as it is the latest and fastest code[^1].


[^1]: Previously, [Silver](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1150.pdf) was faster, but shown insecure in [[RRT23](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/882)].
