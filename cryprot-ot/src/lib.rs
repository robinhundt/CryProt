//! CryProt-OT implements several [oblivious transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblivious_transfer) protocols.
//!
//! - base OT: "Simplest OT" [[CO15](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/267)]
//! - semi-honest OT extension: optimized [[IKNP03](https://www.iacr.org/archive/crypto2003/27290145/27290145.pdf)]
//!   protocol
//! - malicious OT extension: optimized [[KOS15](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/546.pdf)]
//!   protocol
//! - silent OT extension: [[BCG+19](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1159)] silent OT
//!   using [[RRT23](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/882)] code (semi-honest and malicious
//!   with [[YWL+20](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3372297.3417276)]
//!   consistency check)
//!
//! This library is heavily inspired by and in parts a port of the C++ [libOTe](https://github.com/osu-crypto/libOTe) library.
//!
//! ## Benchmarks
//! We continously run the benchmark suite in CI witht the results publicly
//! available on [bencher.dev](https://bencher.dev/perf/cryprot/plots). The raw criterion output, including throughput is
//! available in the logs of the [bench workflow](https://github.com/robinhundt/CryProt/actions/workflows/bench.yml)
//! (latest run > benchmarks job > Run Benchmarks step).
//!
//! ## OT Extension Benchmarks
//! Following are benchmark numbers for several OT protocols on a 4-core VM
//! running on an AMD EPYC 9454P. For up to date benchmarks view the links in
//! the benchmarks section. Each OT sender/receiver uses one worker thread and
//! number of cores many background threads for communication (which by default
//! is also encrypted as part of QUIC).
//!
//! | Benchmark                                         | Mean Throughput (million OT/s) |
//! |--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
//! | Semi-honest R-OT ext. (2^24 R-OTs)       | 51.539                   |
//! | Malicious R-OT ext. (2^24 R-OTs)         | 33.663                   |
//! | Semi-Honest Silent C-OT ext. (2^21 C-OTs)          | 4.2306                   |
//! | Semi-Honest Silent R-OT ext. (2^21 R-OTs)              | 9.5426                   |
//! | Malicious Silent R-OT ext. (2^21 R-OTs)    | 7.4180                   |
//!
//! Silent OT will perform faster for smaller numbers of OTs at slightly
//! increased communication.
//!
//! Our OT implementations should be on par or faster than those in libOTe. In
//! the future we want to benchmark libOTe on the same hardware for a fair
//! comparison.
//!
